    "I'm an aspiring front-end developer working with the fine folks at the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp with the intention of switching careers. I've worked as a sales representative in the craft beer and wine industry for seven years and before that I had seen my fair share of both sides of the bar at some great Raleigh restaurants. When I have free time I enjoy playing and collecting video games and records, skateboarding and taking our dog on adventures.",
