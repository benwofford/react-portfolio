        <p>
          My name is Ben Wofford and I'm an aspiring full stack developer
          working with the fine folks at the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp
          with the intention of switching careers. I've worked as a sales
          representative in the craft beer and wine industry for seven years and
          before that I had seen my fair share of both sides of the bar at some
          great Raleigh restaurants. When I have free time I enjoy playing and
          collecting video games and records, skateboarding and taking our dog
          on adventures.
